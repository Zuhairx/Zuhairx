# 🍮 PT Pudding Menu Management System (Java GUI & MySQL)

PT Pudding Menu Management System is a Java-based desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that integrates with a MySQL database. This application is designed to manage pudding menu data efficiently using full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The system provides an interactive Swing-based interface that allows users to insert new menu items, view existing data, update menu details, and delete records directly from the database. Input validation, database connectivity handling, and real-time table updates are implemented to ensure data accuracy and usability.
